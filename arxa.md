Here I'll be documenting my ongoing project to restore my AR model XA turntable.

The one I'm working had been sitting for at least a couple of years and deserved to get rebuilt - with a few upgrades.


### Before

Pretty awful condition.

Main concerns:
* Heavy degradation of the paint on the metal base of the plinth
* Condition of the foam platter mat
* Replacing the phono cartridge

### Disassembly

Step one was to take the whole thing apart. It's unsurprisingly not too complicated inside.
